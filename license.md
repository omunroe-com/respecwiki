`license` can be one of the following:

* "w3c", currently the default (restrictive) license
* "cc-by", which is experimentally available in some groups (but likely to be phased out). Note that this is a dual licensing regime.
* "cc0", an extremely permissive license. It is only recommended if you are working on a document that is intended to be pushed to the WHATWG.
* "w3c-software", a permissive and attributions license (but GPL-compatible).
* "w3c-software-doc", the W3C Software and [Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document)
