# Documentation Rewrite

The ReSpec documentation, while still mostly accurate, has not been sufficiently updated over time. It could be much clearer in parts, it could make it easier to people to pick it up, and it needs to capture some of the more recent additions.

I've divided this page into various tasks that need to be carried out. It is meant to be heavily edited so that we can reach some agreement on how best to move forward.

## Reorganisation

Trying to organise the content into more usable sections. This is far from complete.

* Getting Started
    * Basic principles
    * Starting from a template
* Reference
    * Document structure
    * Specification status types
    * Inline text
    * Linking
    * WebIDL markup
    * Bibliographical references
* Development
    * Making a build
    * Adding a plugin
    * Making an alternative profile

## Missing Content

This section is intended to list the features that aren't currently documented (or not in full).

XXX

## Misc

**Redirection.** The docs in CVS need to redirect to the docs on GitHub.

**Styling.** Do we want some nice style for this?

**Domain.** Do we want some sort of nice domain?
